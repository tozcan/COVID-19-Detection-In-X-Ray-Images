# COVID-19-Detection-In-X-Ray-Images
A Deep Learning Framework for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Detection in X-Ray Images


"In this study, a grid search (GS) and pre-trained model aided convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed to detect COVID-19 in X-Ray images. In the proposed method, the GS method is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of CNN, which directly affects classification performance. Three pre-trained CNN models (GoogleNet, ResNet18 and ResNet50), which can be used for classification, feature extraction and transfer learning purposes were used for transfer learning."

"Since the COVID-19 appeared in December 2019, it is quite difficult to obtain a public dataset for research work. 
Therefore, the data was obtained from different sources [1-2] and hospital [3] shares."

According to the results ResNet50 aided proposed method is the most successfull one toward others (with %97.69 success rate). 

The code and paper (preprint or published version) will be available soon.
